# UI Component Library Documentation

## Introduction

Our development project utilizes the [Flowbite](https://flowbite.com/) component library, specifically in its [Svelte](https://flowbite-svelte.com/) flavor, to create a consistent and visually appealing user interface. Flowbite is based on Tailwind CSS, providing a rich set of components and styles that can be easily customized to fit our project's requirements.

## Directory Structure

### 1. Components Directory

Basic components, such as buttons and input fields that require customization beyond Flowbite parameters, should be added under the `lib/components` directory. This ensures a centralized location for reusable components that might be used across multiple pages or modules.

### 2. Page Routes

More specific components, tailored to a particular page or module, should be placed in the page route where they are used. This follows the principle of encapsulation and keeps the code organized.

## Styling

[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) classes should be applied in the style section of Svelte components and not inline. This ensures maintainability and consistency throughout the project. The use of the Svelte way for applying Tailwind classes is encouraged for better integration with the Svelte framework.

```html
<style>
  /* Svelte way of applying Tailwind CSS classes */
  .button {
    @apply bg-blue-500 text-white font-bold py-2 px-4 rounded;
  }
</style>

<script>
  // Svelte component logic goes here
</script>

<!-- Svelte component template goes here -->
```

## Customization

While Flowbite provides a wide range of pre-designed components, there might be cases where customization is needed. For such scenarios, it's recommended to extend or create components in the `lib/components` directory to maintain a clean and organized codebase.

## Example Usage

### Button Component

#### `lib/components/Button.svelte`

```html
<script>
  export let label;
</script>

<style>
  .button {
    @apply bg-blue-500 text-white font-bold py-2 px-4 rounded;
  }
</style>

<button class="button">{label}</button>
```

#### Using the Button Component in a Page

```html
<script>
  import Button from '$lib/components/Button.svelte';
</script>

<!-- Page content goes here -->

<Button label="Click me"></Button>
```

## Conclusion

By following these guidelines, we aim to create a modular, maintainable, and consistent UI component library for our development project. The combination of Flowbite with Svelte and Tailwind CSS provides a powerful framework for building elegant and responsive user interfaces.
