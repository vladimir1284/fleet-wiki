# Developer Documentation

Welcome to the Developer Documentation for our Fleet Manager software. This section provides in-depth details on the various aspects of the software development, ensuring that developers have the necessary information to contribute, extend, and maintain the system effectively.

## [Authentication](./auth/)

### Overview
The authentication system is a crucial component of Fleet Manager, ensuring secure access to the application. Developers can find detailed information on user authentication methods, authorization processes, and best practices for enhancing the security of user accounts.

### Implementation Details
Learn about the authentication mechanisms in place, including multi-factor authentication options and integration with third-party identity providers. The documentation covers both backend and frontend aspects of the authentication system.

## [Database](./database/)

### Database Schema
Explore the database schema that underlies Fleet Manager. This section provides a comprehensive overview of the tables, relationships, and data models used to store and manage critical information related to vehicles, drivers, routes, and more.

### Data Migration
Understand the process of data migration, including scripts and procedures for upgrading the database schema as the application evolves. Developers can follow guidelines to ensure seamless transitions during software updates.

## [Credentials](./credentials/)
The credentials needed to work the project are documented in this section. 
! The developer that uses new credentials in its work must update this section and alert the rest of the team.

## API

### RESTful API
Fleet Manager exposes a RESTful API to facilitate seamless integration with other systems and external applications. This section details the available endpoints, request/response formats, and authentication requirements for developers looking to leverage the API.

### Webhooks
Explore the webhook system for real-time updates and notifications. Developers can integrate Fleet Manager with external services by configuring webhooks for specific events within the application.

## Project Structure

### [Action Architecture](./actions/)
The action is a file that is used strictly to interact with prisma. Its usefulness is to avoid direct work with prism in other parts of the project, thus preventing actions that should only occur on the server side from reaching the client, causing a service crash.

### [Backend Architecture](./project/api/)
Get acquainted with the overall structure of the backend codebase. This includes the organization of controllers, models, middleware, and other components. The documentation outlines coding standards and conventions to maintain consistency across the project.

### [Frontend Architecture](./project/client/)
Understand the frontend architecture, including the organization of components, services, and state management. Developers can find information on the chosen frontend framework, its structure, and best practices for efficient development.

## UI Components

### [Component Library](./components/)
Explore the reusable UI components that contribute to the consistent and user-friendly interface of Fleet Manager. The documentation provides guidance on incorporating and customizing these components to maintain a cohesive design language.

## Forms

### [Form Handling](./forms/)
Learn about form design and handling within Fleet Manager. This section covers the implementation of various forms used for data input, validation, and submission. Developers can find examples and best practices for creating dynamic and responsive forms.

We encourage developers to explore the detailed documentation provided in each section to gain a comprehensive understanding of the Fleet Manager software architecture and contribute effectively to its ongoing development.
